# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe, a Python project developed as part of *The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python*. This project aims to implement the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, allowing users to play against the computer. In addition to honing my Python skills, this project serves as a platform to practice documentation and project management techniques.

### Project Goals

- Gain proficiency in Python fundamentals, particularly input/output handling and basic game logic.
- Develop a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game with a user-friendly interface.
- Create a comprehensive README document to facilitate project understanding and usage.
- Utilize version control and GitHub for project management and collaboration.

## Gameplay Overview

The Tic-Tac-Toe game follows standard rules:

- Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid.
- The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
- If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Development Journey

### Displaying the Game Board

The project began with designing a clear and visually appealing game board. Leveraging string formatting and Python's print function, a neat grid layout was achieved to enhance user experience.

### User Input Handling

Efficient handling of user input was crucial. The implementation involved validating input as integers within the valid range (1-9) and ensuring the selected position was available on the board.

### Refactoring and Learning

Refactoring the initial code was necessary to enhance readability and maintainability. Valuable lessons were learned throughout the process, emphasizing the importance of structured problem-solving and iteration.

### Final Implementation

The final code encapsulates all functionalities, including player and computer moves, win detection, and game loop management. The game provides an engaging experience while adhering to best coding practices.
